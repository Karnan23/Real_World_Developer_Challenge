# Real_Dev_Warmup - Day 1

This is my Day 1 warmup project, written as a **real-world dev script** using Python.  

The project demonstrates **file handling, file organization, API calls, OOP, logging, colored terminal output, and task completion reporting** — all structured like a professional script.

---

## Features

- ✅ File handling: create, read, and write text files  
- ✅ File organization: create folders and move files  
- ✅ API call: fetch public GitHub user data  
- ✅ OOP: demonstrate a simple `Developer` class  
- ✅ Logging: track successful operations and errors  
- ✅ Colored terminal output: quickly identify successes and failures  
- ✅ Task completion summary: see total tasks completed/failed at the end  
- ✅ Configurable via `config.json` for folder paths, API URL, and log file

## How to Run

1. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests colorama
```
Make sure config.json is present in the same folder as warmup.py.

2. Run the script:

```bash
python warmup.py
```
Check warmup.log for detailed logs of script execution.
